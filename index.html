                        <p>I love watching that warmth spread across your chest when I kiss your neck. It’s my favorite color, a sign that I’m affecting you, and it makes me want to chase that blush all over your body.</p>

                        <h3>The Sounds You Make</h3>
                        <p>Your gasp when I pull you close, the way you moan as my hand slides down your back. I'm hooked on those sounds, the fucking raw, desperate noises you make. They play in my head all day, a dirty song of my need for you. I crave your moans, your body arching into mine, begging for more. It's filthy, intense, and all I can fucking think about.</p>

                        <p>Just before we kiss, when your eyes go dark and soft and your lips part just a little. In that split second, I know you want me, and the certainty of it drives me absolutely wild.</p>
